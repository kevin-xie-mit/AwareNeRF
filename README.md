# AwareNeRF: Uncertainty-Aware Neural Radiance Fields for Robust Novel View Synthesis

## Overview

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized novel view synthesis, producing stunningly photorealistic images from various viewpoints. However, NeRF's performance critically relies on highly accurate camera parameters during training. In many real-world scenarios, obtaining such precise camera poses is challenging, leading to significant degradation in rendering quality.

**AwareNeRF** is a novel, uncertainty-aware probabilistic framework designed to address this limitation. It enables robust NeRF training even with uncertain camera pose estimates. Unlike existing methods that often introduce restrictive assumptions or high computational overhead, AwareNeRF employs a probabilistic formulation to model and probe pose uncertainty directly within the training process. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of noisy calibration data, leading to improved overall rendering quality without sacrificing computational efficiency.

## Features

* **Probabilistic Pose Uncertainty Modeling:** Explicitly accounts for uncertainty in camera poses by modeling confidence in each camera parameter.
* **Robust Training:** Down-weights the contribution of unreliable poses while amplifying the influence of poses that still yield accurate image reconstructions despite noise.
* **Improved Rendering Quality:** Achieves robust image rendering and consistently outperforms vanilla NeRF, particularly with imperfect camera parameters.
* **Computational Efficiency:** Introduces no additional computational complexity compared to traditional NeRF, nor does it rely on restrictive assumptions.
* **Dynamic Confidence Estimation:** Estimates per-view confidence by leveraging pose perturbations, allowing the model to dynamically adapt to varying levels of pose uncertainty.

## How it Works

AwareNeRF integrates uncertainty-awareness into the NeRF training process by jointly optimizing the scene representation and a learnable per-image pose confidence estimate. For each image, two scalar variables are introduced: a learnable pose-error estimate ($\delta_i \ge 0$) and a derived confidence weight ($w_i = \exp(-\delta_i^2/\tau^2)$).

Instead of attempting to explicitly correct poses, AwareNeRF evaluates the model's sensitivity to small perturbations of the provided camera poses. This sensitivity serves as a proxy for confidence. If the original pose explains the image significantly better than a perturbed one, the loss gradient decreases $\delta_i$, which in turn increases $w_i$, assigning greater trust to that view. Conversely, ambiguous or poor reconstructions increase $\delta_i$, reducing the view's influence. A KL divergence loss regularizes $\delta_i$, preventing it from growing arbitrarily and encouraging low uncertainty unless justified by photometric evidence.

This mechanism enables NeRF to dynamically down-weight supervision from views that are inconsistent under fixed perturbations, thereby improving robustness to noisy or imprecise camera parameters.


## Experiments

Experiments were conducted using two PyTorch implementations of neural radiance fields: one following the original NeRF model and the other incorporating the AwareNeRF methodology with confidence-based reweighting and pose perturbation.

* **Dataset:** Local Light Field Fusion (LLFF) dataset, comprising real-world images of complex scenes captured with a handheld cellphone (8 scenes, 20-62 images per scene, 1008x756 resolution).
* **Evaluation:** One-eighth of the images in each scene were held out as a test set.

AwareNeRF consistently demonstrated improved performance on these real-world datasets with imperfect camera parameters.
